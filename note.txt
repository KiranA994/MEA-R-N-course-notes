HTML - HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE.

markup language

inorder to create design in web pages.

tag based language <>.

eg:- html, xml


opening tag => <h1>

closing tag => </h1>

self closing tags or void element=> <img/> <source/>

IDE - Integrated development environment

visual studio code, eclipse, sublime

syntax- set of rules

basic structure

<html>
<head>
<title></title>  -To give title to a web page.
</head>
<body>
contents are placed here
</body>
</html>


<!-- comments --> - to increase readability

html layout structure - basic structure + semantics
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
semantic tags - It optimize the loading time. It is placed inside the body tag. It is not mandatory.

1)header
2)aside 
3)main
4)footer

alt + z for code refracting
alt + w for wrapping code inside p tag

HTML 5 - latest version
updates ?

html 5 tags
1) heading tags - <h1>,..........,<h6>
2) paragraph tag - <p></p>
3) links => <a> - href - url to navigate
4) images => <img>
5) button => <button>
6) hr - To specify horizontal line
7) iframe - nest the website
8) table - to craete tables
    - thead  - to create heading
    - tbody - to create body of the table
    - tr - to create rows in the table
    - th - heading contents
    - td - body contents
9) list
    - ordered list 
      - <ol>
      - <li> - items
    - unordered list  
      - <ul>
      - <li> 
10) form - to create forms
11) placeholder
12) div - to create division in webpage
13) span - to style separately within a content in an html element.

attributes - gives additional information to a given tag.

eg: - href, target of a tag.

block level elements => start in a new line - a, heading tags, p

inline level eleemnts => start in the same line - img,button 


html: 5
-------

-media updation

video tag - to embed downloaded video

audio tag - to embed audio 

figure tags - for placing images 
            - additionally provide captions
            - block level element

iframe tags - inline level element

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CSS - Cascading Style Sheet 

- To provide styling to the web contents.

Different way of using CSS

- inline CSS
      - style atrribute is used to provide style
      - syntax => style="property:value"

- internal css
      syntax   => <style>
                    tagname{
                      property:value;
                    }
                  </style>
      - style should be placed inside head tag.   

- external css
     link tag - is used to connect external css file with the html file.

     external css file - filename.css

better approach - external css

- less complexity 

- loading time reduces

- css reusabiliy


priority order

1) inline
2) internal
3) external


CSS Selectors

1) tagname Selectors
2) id selectors - to style uniquely
3) class selectors - to style in a group
4) universal selector - to style entire document
5) descendent selector - parent child{}


css box model
-------------
1) border - imaginary (by default it is not visible) line around the content
2) margin - space between border and outer space
3) padding - space between border and the content
             padding - effect all side
             padding-top, padding-bottom, padding-left, padding-right


border-radius - to give curves to the edges.

display:flex - to place all child tag in inline level.

cdn - content delivery network - to access content of one network to another network 

display: inline-block - respects both top and bottom margin and padding as compared to display:flex.


CSS Grid System

display - grid system( will divide it into rows and column)

grid-template-column - It specifices number and size of column inside that particular grid

grid-template-row - It specifices number and size of rows inside that particular grid

column-gap - specifies gap between the columns

row-gap - specifies gap between the rows

relative positioning  -> moves an element relative to its default position on the page.
while absolute positioning -> moves an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.

media query
-----------

- used to create responsive website.

phones - max-width:600px (below and up to 600px)
portrait tablets, large phones - min-width:600px and above
landscape tablets - min-width:768px and above
laptop/desktops - min-width:992px and above
large laptops and desktops - min-width:1200px and above

visibility:hidden - the content is only hidden but it exists in dom.

display: none -the content is hidden in dom as well as in ui.

---------------------------------------
individual project - restaurant website
---------------------------------------

Bootstrap
---------

- framework - work within frames
- It have predefined classes which can be used to style contents.
- It is a framework of html, css, javascript.

modal
card
pagination
offcanvas
navbar

Bootstrap grid system
---------------------

- consists of rows and columns

- each row contains 12 basic columns

responsive 
----------

xs <576px	 - phone

sm ≥576px	- tablets

md ≥768px	- laptops

lg ≥992px	- large laptops and desktops

xl ≥1200px	

xxl ≥1400px

project - travel website - html css bootstrap grid system

git and github
--------------

- github are used to share code.

- cloud based 

- version control system

- hosting - can hoist website created using basic frontend technologies such as html, css, bootstrap, javascript.

git is a tool to do operations in github.

storage
-------
github storage space - remote repository 

git storage space - local repository


git operations
--------------
1) push - local to remote repository - uploading code
2) clone - remote to local repo - downloading code - enntire code.
3) pull - remote to local repo - downloading code - updated code.


git add - from our computer local storage to staging area
git commit - from staging area to local repository
git push - from local repo to remote repo

comments
--------
git init - to create a empty git repository for that particular folder.
git status - to see uncommited or untracked files
git add - to add file into staging area
create remote repository in github
git remote add origin http-url - to connect local repo and newly created remote repo
git push origin master - to push data from master to origin.
git clone url
git pull url

javascript
----------

javascript is a single threaded programming language since it excecutes the code line by line.

It is also a dynamically typed language - data type changes.

javascript can be used in both front end as well as backend.

frontend - it gives behaviour

backend - it is used to do logical operations.

JS is compiled using node.

extension - .js

data types - 8
-----------

1) string - single quotes or double quotes
2) boolean - true or false
3) number 


method to check data types
--------------------------
typeOf()

concatenation
-------------
to join or add same or different data type

string + string = string
string + number = string
number + number = number

variables
---------
- used to store data
- identifiers - set of rules to create variables.

1) start with dollar, underscore, letters.
2) subsequent characters can be letters, digits, underscore etc.
3) If more than one word second word should begin with capital letter or use underscore between the words and no space between the words.



variableName = value;

keywords variableName = value;

keywords is a set of reserved words which gives a special meaning to variables.

cannot be used as variable name and function name.

1) const - its value does not change. 
           reassigning is not possible.
           hoisting is not possible.

2) var - value changes throughout - reassigning is possible.
         hoisting is possible.
         functional level access

3) let - reassigning is possible.
         accessible inside a block.
         hoisting is not possible.


hoisting
--------
using of variables before it is declared or created.

template literals
-----------------
- it is a way of displaying content.
- `content ${variable}`

operator
--------
1) Assignment operator =
2) Arithematic operator 
   addition +
   subtraction -
   division /
   multiplication *
   modulus %
   exponential **
3) relational operators
   > >= < <= == ===
   will return true or false   
   == -> return true if compared values are equal
   === -> return true if data type and compared values are same
4) logical operators -joins two or more relational operators. It return boolean value.
   and && 
   or  || 
   not !

   T && T = T
   T && F = F
   F && T = F
   F && F = F

   T || T = T
   T || F = T
   F || T = T
   F || F = F

   !T = F
   !F = T

5) increment and decrement operator
 ++ 
 --

6) shorthand operator
x = x + y  => x+=y
x= x- y    => x-=y

7) ternary operator

   condition ? true statement : false statement;

   if else -> 

conditional statements/decision making statements
-------------------------------------------------

if else
     
     if(condition){
        statement
     }
     else if(condition){
      
     }
     else{
        statement
     }

looping statements
------------------
to do task repeatedly

1) while loop 

   while(condition){
      task
      condition to exit the loop (increment / decrement) )
   }

2) for loop
   
   for(variable initialization; condition; increment/decrement){
      statement
   }

   break- It is used to exit forcefully from a loop.

   nested loop - loop inside another loop

1) functions
---------
same task is repeatedly executed at different locations.

functions have two parts

1) function definition

   - where we define the task 

   syntax
   ------

   function functionname(arg1, ....argn){
      task
   }

2) function call
   - to execute the task.

   syntax
   ------

   functionname(arg1,........,argn)

functional hoisting - calling a function before its definition is known as functional hoisting

variable of a function is having block level scope.

It is not accessible from outside the function.

But if it is needed we need to return the variable from function.

2) arrow function
   --------------

   syntax
   ------
   keyword variable = (arg1,.....,argn) => {

   }

   variable()

3) predefined functions
   --------------------
   comsole.log()
   Number()
   typeof()
   Math.floor()
   parseInt()


4) call back functions
   -------------------
   The function calling another function are called call back functions.

   setTimeOut() - call back function, to provide time delay
   arrow functions can be used as call back function

5) asynchronous function
The functions which has time delay
API calls is asynchronous.

6) synchronous function
function with no time delay 

eg:- console.log()


7) nested functions
   ----------------
   function inside another function

   closure property in nested function
   -----------------------------------
   parent properties can be accessed from child but not possible in vice versa

   
Data structure
--------------
It is a specialized format of organizing retrieving, processing and storing data.

eg:- array, list, linked list, stack, queue, tree, graph

array
-----

definition
----------

array is a single variable which can store more than one value 
of different data type that are seperated by commas and enclosed
within square bracket.

- array is infinite in javascript.
- unlike variables array can hold more than one data or value.
- array can store more than one data type.
- stored as key: value pairs
- key - index position
- value - data

index - indicates the position of elements and array.
value - start from 0 to arraylength-1.

length - number of items or data inside the array.
length start from 1.

representation / syntax
-----------------------

keyword variable = [item1,.......,itemn]

array operations
----------------

1) push() - to add data at the end of an array.

2) unshift() - to add data at the beggining of an array.

3) pop() - to remove an item from array.

4) shift() - to remove item from the start.

Different way of accessing array elements
-----------------------------------------
1) for loop
2) for in - directly access the index of the array
3) for of - directly access the value of an array
